UrbanExploration

Description
My project is about urban exploration; from the places I've visited as an urban explorer,
the places I hope to visit, to the background information and warnings/risks of the hobby.


Custom CSS Classes
    Some of the classes I created are:
        1. .rotateimg 
            this class rotates an image
        2. .info::after, .link::after, .sticky::after
                keeps sticky footer below the content
        3. .PText
                makes text over one of the carousel images black & boldened


Custom JavaScript Functions
    The JavaScript functions I created are:
        1. function blink_text() {$('.warning').fadeOut(5);$('.warning').fadeIn(650);}
                function blink_text is used to make the heading of the warning page flash red text.
