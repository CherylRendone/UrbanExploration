        <p class="description">As I've previously mentioned, I've only just begun to scratch the surface of urban exploring. I enjoy
          doing the research, finding the locations and learning about their history. Below, I will mention just a 
          few of the abandoned places I hope to visit in the future.</p>

        <h4 class="bucketlist">Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant</h4>
            <img src="images/chernobylZoom.jpg" class="chernobyl img-fluid" alt="Deserted buildings near Chernobyl">

        <p class="description">A very popular place is located in Pripyat, Ukraine where the Chernobyl explosion occured. The Chernobyl
          disaster was a nuclear accident that occured on April 26th, 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.
          This disaster is said to be one of only two nuclear energy disasters rated at seven which is the maximum
          severity on the International Nuclear Event Scale.</p>
          
        <!-- "hide" class used here to remove this text when using smaller screen size -->
        <p class="description hide">The accident started while there was a safety test being done on an RBMK-type nuclear reactor; the test
          was a simmulation of an electrical power outage to help in the development of a safety procedure for
          maintaining cooling water circulation until the back-up generators could provide power. The operating gap
          was about one minute and had been identified as a potential safety problem which could cause the nuclear
          reactor core to overheat. There had been three previous tests conducted since 1982, but a solution was
          never found. For the fourth attempt, the test had been delayed by 10 hours, so the operating shift that
          had been prepared for the testing was not present. Unfortunately, the testing supervisor failed to follow
          the procedure, creating an unstable operating condition. The unstable condition combined with inherent
          RBMK reactor design flaws and the intentional disabling of several nuclear reactor safety systems, resulted
          in an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction. This released a large amount of enery vapourising superheated
          cooling water and rupturing the reactor core in a highly destructive steam explosion. This was immediately
          followed by the open-air reactor core fire that released a considerable amount of airborne radioactive
          contamination for roughly nine days before it was finally contained on May 4th, 1986.</p>

        <p class="description">An area known as "the zone of alienation" is largely uninhabited with the exception of about 300 residents
          who have refused to leave. Today, the radiation levels are still so high that the workers rebuilding the
          sarcophagus around the site are only allowed to work five hours per day for a month before being required
          to take 15 days of rest. As of 2016, 187 locals returned and were living permanently in the zone. As of
          2011, Ukraine opened up the sealed zone around the Chernobyl reactor to tourists who wish to learn more
          about the tragedy.

        <h4 class="bucketlist">Disney's River Country</h4>
          <img src="images/riverCountry.jpg" class="disney" alt="Aerial view of Disney's River Country">

        <p class="description">Disney's River Country was the first water park at Walt Disney World. The water park
          is located along the shores of Bay Lake near Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground; it was themed
          as a rustic, old-fashioned swimming hole. The water park was opened on June 20th, 1976 and closed indefinitely
          on November 2nd, 2001. The water parks permanent closure was announced on January 20th, 2005, making River
          Country the second of only two Disney parks in the company's history to close permanently.
        </p>

        <p class="description">On March 5th, 2018, Disney filed permits to build a nature-themed deluxe resort called
          Reflections - A Disney Lakeside Lodge. The resort is slated to have 900 hotel rooms and is planned to open 
          in 2022.
